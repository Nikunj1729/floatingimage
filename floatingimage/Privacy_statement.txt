Floating Image Privacy Statement - Facebook

Floating Image does not send any information to anyone. Any information that is gathered through the use of Floating Image is gathered either by the services used, or by Google via the Android operating system. This is a matter that has nothing to do with the developer of Floating Image.

Your privacy and private life is important to the Floating Image developer team (of one) and not interesting at all, respectively.

In short: No information is collected through your use of Floating Image, that will not be collected through your use of any other similar app (which most likely will collect a whole lot more data, most of which shouldn't concern you either).

Have fun, and thank you for caring about your privacy.

This statement may change without any notice or reason.
